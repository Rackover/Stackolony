  <eventDescription>
    <event1>Can we have a cotton candy machine installed in the Relaxing lounge "1" or that one small request is asking too much? It will obviously be specially made for us and not for other breeds because they do not need it. Our well-being must be your priority.</event1>
    <event2>Good morning... I live in a very nice place, but the look of $CITYNAME doesn't fit my personality at all. With your agreement, I would like to carve and paint all around my home to prove my artistic value to all!</event2>
    <event3>Greetings ! My men and I need a lot of spinach to get even better! I noticed in some of my men a decline in health because of a poor diet and it isn't tolerable! I come to see you to have an extra supply of food for his men! End Call!</event3>
    <event4>I just had a brilliant, brilliant idea!! I can tinker a little something with a crystal that I ... borrowed from the mine I explored! Let me hack the plant "2" for a while, and after that, it will be even more powerful!</event4>
    <event5>Hel ... Hello, I come to see you because the factory "3" is starting to get very dirty and I ... I would like to clean it. But there are always too many people inside! Can you please shut down part of the factory so that I can clean it up ... everywhere? Many people are starting to cough because of the dust.</event5>
    <event6>Between naps, I had a wonderful idea, that my friends immediately applauded. I would like to organize a contest of "Trash throwing" on barracks "2". I find the concept very interesting and it will make an extra occupation to these Kavga brutes.</event6>
    <event7>We created,a friend and me, an ingenious system of wired communication! We use two pots connected to a wire. But this communication system is short-range. We must scream in the handset ... Although it may embarrass the other inhabitants of $CITYNAME, science has no time to lose!</event7>
    <event8>I ... I've been separated from my family since I left to join this colony and I have the opportunity to bring them here thanks to ... Thanks to an acquaintance. Can they come in the next batch of settlers?</event8>
    <event9>The crystals found in a mine are great! I would like to study them, with a research method that uses sulfur, nitroglycerin, potassium nitrate and stones! They are harmless stones, do not worry! Can I ?</event9>
    <event10>We find factory "3" really not pretty in this beautiful colony that you built ... With your consent, we can undertake a special renovation ... Of course it won't be a real factory anymore, but the building will be more pleasing to the eye.</event10>
    <event11>Greetings ! I discovered in house "1" traces of small woodlice! Many people tell me that they are harmless but I don't believe it! I can go and pacify this area if you allow me! End of communication.</event11>
    <event12>The period of the banquet of art has arrived! We celebrate nature, water and the natural energy that flows from it. We will need extra food because food is life.</event12>
    <event13>Hello. To help those poor people who are working hard at the factory, I decided to make a gesture. So that they don't think they're working for nothing, I can turn on all the lights in my house. Yes, I am a great person. This might make them feel more important</event13>
    <event14>Labor Day has begun, a feast that dates back to our old planet! During this holiday, we work more and faster! The faster our tools overheat, the more we laugh ... May we ... Can we ... start this celebration now?</event14>
    <event15>On this sweet day, with my group, we composed a piece of very pure music, which advocates open-mindedness, good nature and thoughtfulness. We composed this song to be played at 125 Db, so that our neighbors could hear this magnificent quartet. Can we start?</event15>
    <event16>We've been investigating a hazardous issue on [A]'s power accumulators for the past week and we believe we found the source of the problem was coming from. With your agreement, boss, we would like to proceed with replacing the faulty part.</event16>
    <event17>We are a lot of Senuths to think that this colony is too simple, not attractive enough to see, not to mention the smells ... But that's not the question! We would like to see in this colony a real tower, aesthetic, powerful and impacting!</event17>
    <event18>With four friends, we are creating one of the most beautiful sculptures ever invented! We are almost there but we need peace and space ... Can you book workshop "2" to mark the story?</event18>
    <event19>Greeting ! A slightly stamped scientist came to see us to show us a new type of "revolutionary" weapon, which uses crystals in my opinion. If we manage to handle them, we will be able to atta... Defend the colony of its critters even more effectively! But ... It will be necessary to manage to handle them ... Authorization granted?</event19>
    <event20>Please stop your activities to listen to us. Well. We contacted friends from another colony and discovered spices that turn into delicious food when in contact with energy. We can ask our friends to send us large barrels of spices, to convert the electricity of the spaceport into food. We like good food.</event20>
    <event21>Sorry to disturb you, we are many to say that looking for new mines would be interesting for the colony, because our mines will not be eternal ... Can you handle it?</event21>
    <event22>Well, we just come to see you to say we want two new casinos. We do not have enough, we love opulence. You are, apparently, an intelligent person ... Apparently ... We should not have to tell you. And if that is not done ..</event22>
    <event23>We have heard that the "Walterberg" colony makes candies that make them more creative and that allow them to see different colors. The only drawback is that these sweets make you want to eat even more ... Still, we are interested, can we have some?</event23>
    <event24>Greeting ! We are going to start a period of weight loss, we are going to be on the teeth, but we will not use them! The food is outlawed! You agree ? End of communication!</event24>
    <event25>We think that one television per room in all high houses would be the least. We like shows where 100 Kavgas have to fight until there is only one left. So please provide us these televisions. For each home.</event25>
    <event26>Hello haha ââ!! We want to test a new mode of communication based on laser! So, it's a little dangerous, but hey! These are only small "Nucleoexplonapalmocute" type lasers! With your agreement, we can test this laser to the sky, to communicate with the transport vessels of buildings ... Otherwise we will do it in the city! No worries do not worry!</event26>
    <event27>Hello, spaceport here. We will receive our first settlers tomorrow. These are covridians, a breed that particularly appreciates science. So they need a house and a laboratory, so they can work here. You will find these buildings at the bottom left of your management screen, you can place them by clicking and depositing directly on the field. You can place a high house under the spaceport to connect it. Then place a laboratory underneath him too.</event27>
    <event28>Hello, spaceport here. To connect the buildings to each other, other than the ones on top of each other, you can connect them with bridges. Hold the [SHIFT] key to bridge two buildings at the same height. Buildings connected by bridges are considered adjacent, regardless of the distance between them.</event28>
    <event29>Hello, spaceport here. We will soon receive Krowsers. It is a race loving to work in galleries. They would need a factory to work in the mine. In addition, they do not necessarily appreciate luxury housing, an average home will be perfect for them. Place the factory so that it is adjacent to the mine and the average home not far from it. For these buildings to work, they need energy. They must be connected to your city.</event29>
    <event30>Hel ... Hello ... We apologize, but for us to work, we would need access to the mine from the factory. The factory must be connected to the mine by a bridge. In addition ... Our buildings need a lot of electricity and the spaceport does not provide enough ... Can you put a plant to generate more? Thank you ... And sorry for the inconvenience!</event30>
    <event31>Hello, spaceport here. Buildings need electricity to operate. As for the settlers, they need food. We can provide some electricity and some food from the spaceport, but not enough for the next comers. The kavga are a warrior race that will not like not having enough food. Please order a food distributor and a fire station so that they can exercise their ... Work. They will be able to live in average homes.</event31>
    <event32>Kavga: Good morning! We need access to the nests of critters that populate this planet. This is probably a source of danger, we will take care of it! The nests of critters regenerate little by little and the more we are on these nests, the more the nest will lose creatures! Yaah !! Hum ... End of communication.</event32>
    <event33>Hello, spaceport here. Earis are on their way to our colony. It is a peaceful breed, for whom art takes precedence over everything, they generally like working at height, it allows them to better see the landscape. In addition, they appreciate the accommodations without any comfort. Please order a low dwelling and a workshop.</event33>
    <event34>Krowsers: Hmm ... Hello ... The Earis have arrived and are very happy to be here ... They ... are having a party and I'm afraid it's going to get out of hand ... Can you ... Could you put a police building and a fire brigade? In case ... Thank you ... I do not want my family living in a dilapidated place ... And then you will not have to deal with them, these buildings handle the problems that are within their range. Th...Thank you.</event34>
    <event35>Kavga: Greetings! The Earis have put everything upside down! Fortunately you have placed buildings to block their enthusiasm. Otherwise, we would have solved that ourselves. We should now fix their nonsense with a repair building in range. End of transmission.</event35>
    <event36>Hello, spaceport here. Senuths are about to arrive. It is a race formerly very developed and very rich. You must order a high dwelling and ... A lounge. These people do not really like work, being used to idleness.</event36>
    <event37>Here we go, try to survive as long as possible !</event37>
