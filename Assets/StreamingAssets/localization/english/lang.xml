Debriefing of Davis, the Covridian: "They thought that I was lowering their intellect.I still say that the Kavgas have less patience than all other people,  science demonstrated it. "</bulletin8>
    <bulletin9>The US (Union Stellar) has just installed a spaceport in a planet that they have just named Orro Rotrin, a new victory!</bulletin9>
    <bulletin10>The famous T27 carrier, containing more than 1 billion settlers and more than 20 million buildings, was hit by space debris, the shock may hit the neighboring planets.</bulletin10>
    <bulletin11>In the Enu'aj Teligg colony of the Ho'gonu star system, Senuths are on strike. No change in the colony.</bulletin11>
    <bulletin12>The Stello project, which claimed to be revolutionary, was aborted.The decision comes from the top of the spacepole.The risks of failure were too big.</bulletin12>
    <bulletin13>The ambassador and founder of the third Colony rests on the planet he served for a century. Here are the last words of the ambassador: "Stack blocks, manage stupid people, it's over for me, Goodbye!" A poignant testimony.</bulletin13>
    <bulletin14>The Tchekek Empire claims a stellar system from the US territory. The authorities react by populating the system.</bulletin14>
    <bulletin15>A collaborative project between Covridians and Kavgas gives rise to a revolutionary military technology. The Kavga Army is eager to try this new weapon. The population is more afraid of the consequences than anything else.</bulletin15>
    <bulletin16>The death of a star has given rise to a black hole. More than 20 ships have been absorbed by this hole, and the traffic within the territory of the US reaches the red level.</bulletin16>

    <bulletin19>The orchestra "Earythm" will make a great tour throughout the Stellar Union across all settlements, before playing the grand finale in the high neighborhoods of the spacepole. A Senuth says about the Tour : "I can do better, and all by myself. Blowing in a pipe and waving his arms, it's within the reach of anyone."</bulletin19>
    <bulletin20>Recent research about the extinction of the original system shows that the star did not go out naturally. An investigation launch to solve this mystery which concerns all the population of the US.</bulletin20>
    <bulletin21>Public enemy number 2, Vortex has once again escaped from the Union's most secure prison, with its natural gift for creating portals to a safe place. This is the 87th time this month.

    <bulletin25>A museum just opened in Sector 2 of the Spatiopole. We can see all preserved works of the original system. Just the thing to preserve the culture of our forgotten ancestors.</bulletin25>
    <bulletin26>The old spaceport of one of the first settlement has collapsed under its own weight. The first guilty in this case is the ambassador of Colony 2, in charge of the urban placement. He apparently built a tower of 57 buildings. He said : "I wanted to see if there was a limit!" His limit is now the walls of prison.</bulletin26>
    <bulletin27>The planet Dortus Laan is recently the source of a conflict between the Tchekek empire and SU. Su has put a spaceport there. The empire reacts by installing one of its bases on the other side of the planet, making of this crisis of territory a race towards the colonialization.</bulletin27>
    <bulletin28>The high lady of the Tchekek empire died last night. This piece of news does not only sadden the empire, the entire population of the Union is touched. Indeed, the lady facilitated relations between the two camps. The peace of the universe is weakened by her death.</bulletin28>

  <eventDescription>
    <event1>Can we have a cotton candy machine in the lounge or is it asking too much? It will obviously be specially made for us and not for other breeds because they don't need it. Our well-being must be your priority.A better lounge for Senuths.</event1>
    <event2>Well hello... I live in a very nice place, but the look of $CITY_NAME doesn't fit my personality at all.With your agreement, I would like to carve and paint all around my home to prove my artistic value to all!A Better house for an Eari.</event2>
    <event3>Greetings !My men and I need a lot of spinach to even get  better! I noticed in some of my men a decline in health because of a poor diet, it isn't tolerable!I came to see you to have an extra supply of food for those men! Over and out!More food for Kavgas ! </event3>
    <event4>I just had a brilliant, brilliant idea!! I can do a little something with a crystal that I ... borrowed from the mine I explored!Let me tinker with a Factory for some time, and after that, it will be even more powerful!A Covridian's idea.</event4>
    <event5>Hel ... Hello, I come to see you because a factory is starting to get very dirty and I ... I would like to clean it. But there are always too many people inside!Can you please shut down a part of the factory so that I can clean it up ... almost everywhere?Many people are starting to cough because of the dust.Clean the factory ?</event5>
    <event6>Between naps, I had a wonderful idea, that my friends immediately applauded.I would like to organize a contest of "Trash throwing" on barracks.I find the concept very interesting and it will make an extra occupation to these Kavgas brutes.A new game for Senuths !</event6>
    <event7>A friend and me created an ingenious system of wired communication!We use two pots connected to one wire. But this communication system is a short-range one. We must scream in the handset ... Even if it may embarrass the other inhabitants of $CITY_NAME, science has no time to lose!Help the two Covridians to finish their invention.</event7>
    <event8>I ... I've been separated from my family since my departure to join this colony and I have the opportunity to bring them here thanks to ... Thanks to an acquaintance. Can they come in the next batch of settlers?Welcome the family of the lonely inhabitant?</event8>

    <event12>The period of the art banquet has arrived!We celebrate nature, water and the natural energy that flows from it.We will need extra food because food represents life. In fact, fat is life.More food for Earis.</event12>
    <event13>Hello.In order to help those poor people who are working hard at the factory, I decided to make a move.So that they don't think they work for nothing, I can turn on all the lights in my house . Yes, I am a great person. They might feel more important..Offer the light of hope.</event13>

    <event1000>$PLAYER_NAME, I'm afraid you may have upset the settlers. A lot that I fear you won't find anyone to follow your words anymore. The population is tired and angry.
